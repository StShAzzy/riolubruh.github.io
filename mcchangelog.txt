Made it so that there is only one AppData folder instead of two
-Used symlinking to switch between the vanilla and modded minecraft jars instead of using a different AppData folder

Compressed file size was reduced from 210MB to 166MB (nice!)
-Uncompressed file size was also reduced by a lot
-The file will now take less time to extract!

Definitely not going to make a Linux version cause there is no reason to
